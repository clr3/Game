The Ooze
You notice a small, pulsating puddle of ooze on the ground in-font of you. As you approach it suddenly leaps at your leg and attaches tightly. After a brief struggle you throw it off and it squirms away. Surprisingly, the ordeal has left you feeling reinvigorated, if a little disgusted.

Ancient Obelisk
A giant, unnaturally smooth pillar of rock sits on the hill in-front of you. You approach and touch the obelisk without thinking and find yourself overwhelmed with feelings unlike anything you have experienced. You fade in unconsciousness… You awake shaken, but unharmed with the obelisk nowhere in sight.
