The Ooze
You notice a small, pulsating puddle of ooze on the ground in-font of you. As you approach it suddenly leaps at your leg and attaches tightly. After a brief struggle you throw it off and it squirms away. Surprisingly, the ordeal has left you feeling reinvigorated, if a little disgusted.

Ancient Obelisk
A giant, unnaturally smooth pillar of rock sits on the hill in-front of you. You approach and touch the obelisk without thinking and find yourself overwhelmed with feelings unlike anything you have experienced. You fade in unconsciousness… You awake shaken, but unharmed with the obelisk nowhere in sight.

Abandoned Colony
You come across what seems to be a colony much like your own but ruined and abandoned. You quickly scavenge some materials and leave feeling deeply disturbed by the knowledge that you are not the first humans to land on this supposedly uncharted planet.

Not all this world’s wildlife is hostile, some of them seem completely passive. Studying this will be a task for more well-provisioned colonies, however.

Night Terrors
As you try to sleep, strange noises from the darkness unsettle you. You think that it must just be the alien equivalent of crickets chirping but it disturbs you all the same. Are the noises coming closer?
